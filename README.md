# Salary-Predictor-for-Employee
Hello Guys... Like I mentioned in my Shah Rukh Khan Movie Predictor, "Picture abhi Baaki hai mere dost" so here the Upgraded Machine Learning Model
💰 Employee Salary Predictor – Machine Learning Project

“Predicting salaries before they even offer!” – A hands-on ML project to estimate employee compensation using historical data.

🚀 Project Overview

This project predicts employee salaries based on features like experience, skill score, age, and education level. It’s a practical way to showcase your data analytics, regression modeling, and visualization skills for internship applications.

Objective: Predict salaries accurately using Linear Regression.

Tools & Skills:

Python, Pandas

scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

Train-test split, model evaluation, and prediction

Data visualization (Matplotlib)

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains numeric employee features:

Feature	Type	Description
Experience (Years)	Numeric	Years of professional experience
Skill Score	Numeric	Performance or skill rating (1–10)
Age	Numeric	Employee age
Education Level	Numeric	Coded education level (e.g., 1 = Bachelor, 2 = Master, 3 = PhD)
Salary	Numeric	Annual salary (Target)

(Dataset is synthetic for practice purposes but realistic enough for ML modeling)

🧰 How It Works

Load Data: Read CSV and inspect data.

Feature Selection: Choose numeric features for the model.

Train-Test Split: Separate 80% training data, 20% testing data.

Model Training: Fit a Linear Regression model to learn patterns.

Prediction & Evaluation: Predict salaries for unseen test data and visualize performance.

Visualization: Compare actual vs predicted salaries using scatter plots.
